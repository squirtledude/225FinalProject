# 225FinalProject
Final Project for CS 225

Team Contract


- Communication 

Meetings:
Thursday at 6pm, either at Grainger Library or over Discord 
If there is a conflict, the expectation is that team members communicate in advance and we change the date.
Assistance:
If assistance is needed by team members, team members can either contact in the Discord group-chat, or a direct message. Responses expected in less than a day 
Respect: 
Every team member should speak up if they have questions/are lost. 
All ideas brought up by team members shall be considered and discussed.
If ideas are created outside of dis


- Collaboration 

Work dist:
First, we will identify strengths of team members and distribute tasks in a way that compliments each other’s strengths. Workload will be given in the most even way possible. If a particular task is time consuming, multiple people will be assigned to that task.
Each week, there will be a group meeting, and each group member is assigned a particular task and expected to finish it in a week.  
Time commitment 
Each group member will spend no less than 2 hours and more than 6 hours. If one of the group members needs more time to complete their weekly works, other group members will be assigned to work on the other’s work if possible. As this project consists of different group members, it is crucial to make sure all of the weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 

Conflict resolution:
We understand that conflicts may arise within the group, but we are committed to resolving them in a respectful and timely manner. If a conflict arises, we will:	
Listen actively to each other's perspectives without interrupting or judging.
Communicate honestly and respectfully with each other.
Work collaboratively to find a mutually acceptable solution.
Seek the help of a mediator if we are unable to resolve the conflict on our own.
